## Data
We used the newly released dataset [ChID](https://github.com/zhengcj1/ChID-Dataset).
Users of this repo are encouraged to read their paper to get detailed descriptions of each splits.

We also contribute a large corpus to do Chengyu-oriented pretraining, see the TALLIP paper below.

Our data is shared via [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r2G1KNmITPNsm1jZK0XWtf6jXI7MaZfo?usp=sharing) and the directory has the following structure
```shell script

```

## Pretrained Models
We choose to use pretrained models hosted on [🤗 models](https://huggingface.co/models). 
For example, one can configure `pretrained_model_name_or_path=hfl/chinese-bert-wwm-ext` in the configuration file to use
[chinese-bert-wwm-ext](https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-bert-wwm-ext).
For other pretrained models, one can get from their online repos and put it into `data/pretrained` as following:
```shell script
(base) mhtan@chase ➜  ChengyuBERT git:(master) ✗ tree data/pretrained

## Dual Embeddings

``` bibtex
@inproceedings{tan-jiang-2020-bert,
    title = "A {BERT}-based Dual Embedding Model for {C}hinese Idiom Prediction",
    author = "Tan, Minghuan  and Jiang, Jing",
    booktitle = "Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics",
    month = dec,
    year = "2020",
    address = "Barcelona, Spain (Online)",
    publisher = "International Committee on Computational Linguistics",
    url = "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.113",
    pages = "1312--1322",
    abstract = "Chinese idioms are special fixed phrases usually derived from ancient stories, whose meanings are oftentimes highly idiomatic and non-compositional. The Chinese idiom prediction task is to select the correct idiom from a set of candidate idioms given a context with a blank. We propose a BERT-based dual embedding model to encode the contextual words as well as to learn dual embeddings of the idioms. Specifically, we first match the embedding of each candidate idiom with the hidden representation corresponding to the blank in the context. We then match the embedding of each candidate idiom with the hidden representations of all the tokens in the context thorough context pooling. We further propose to use two separate idiom embeddings for the two kinds of matching. Experiments on a recently released Chinese idiom cloze test dataset show that our proposed method performs better than the existing state of the art. Ablation experiments also show that both context pooling and dual embedding contribute to the improvement of performance.",

```

### Preprocessing

On the ChID official released dataset
```shell script
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/bert-wwm-ext_official.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations official_train
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/bert-wwm-ext_official.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations official_dev
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/bert-wwm-ext_official.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations official_test
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/bert-wwm-ext_official.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations official_sim
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/bert-wwm-ext_official.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations official_ran
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/bert-wwm-ext_official.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations official_out
```

On the ChID competition dataset, 
```shell script
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/roberta-wwm-ext-large_competition.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations competition_train
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/roberta-wwm-ext-large_competition.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations competition_dev
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/roberta-wwm-ext-large_competition.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations competition_test
CONFIG_FILE="dual_embedding/roberta-wwm-ext-large_competition.json" bash docker_preprocess.sh $PWD/data/annotations competition_out
```
For more information about the competition, please refer to [Chinese Idiom Understanding Contest](https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/idiom/).

Since our `txt_db` may be preprocessed via different tokenizers, we use the model path or name as part of the db's path.
If the user is sure that the models sharing the same tokenizer and vocabulary, one can use relative soft link to avoid repeated preprocessing.
```shell script
└── txt_db
    ├── hfl
    │   └── chinese-bert-wwm-ext
    │       ├── external_pretrain.db
    │       ├── official_dev.db
    │       ├── official_out.db
    │       ├── official_ran.db
    │       ├── official_sim.db

## Two Stage

We collect a large corpus as described in the TALLIP paper, and do a two-stage training using this corpus and further fine-tuning over ChID.

```bibtex

    abstract = {In Chinese, Chengyu are fixed phrases consisting of four characters. As a type of
    idioms, their meanings usually cannot be derived from their component characters.
    In this article, we study the task of recommending a Chengyu given a textual context.
    Observing some of the limitations with existing work, we propose a two-stage model,
    where during the first stage we re-train a Chinese BERT model by masking out Chengyu
    from a large Chinese corpus with a wide coverage of Chengyu. During the second stage,
    we fine-tune the re-trained, Chengyu-oriented BERT on a specific Chengyu recommendation
    dataset. We evaluate this method on ChID and CCT datasets and find that it can achieve
    the state of the art on both datasets. Ablation studies show that both stages of training
    are critical for the performance gain.},

```

```

## Learning and Evaluating Chinese Idiom Embeddings
We study the task of learning and evaluating Chinese idiom embeddings.
We first construct a new evaluation dataset that contains idiom synonyms and antonyms.
Observing that existing Chinese word embedding methods may not be suitable for learning idiom embeddings, we further present a BERT-based method that directly learns embedding vectors for individual idioms.
We empirically compare representative existing methods and our method.
We find that our method substantially outperforms existing methods on the evaluation dataset we have constructed.
